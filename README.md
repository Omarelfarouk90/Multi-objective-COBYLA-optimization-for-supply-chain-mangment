# Multi-objective-COBYLA-optimization-for-supply-chain-mangment
it involves the implementation of pareto forntier for 3 objectives in the supply chain optimization 
the code represents the applicaiton of a multiobjective cobyla in supply chain . follow the guided stepts in the note book for 
addint constraints and modeling the optimization problem
